## Reverse Food Image Search

Final project for McGill Artificial Intelligence Society's machine learning bootcamp. 

## What it does
Our iOS app takes in an image of a food and item and with some ML magic outputs the name of the dish! Try it out for yourself! Can currently categorize food into one of 70 categories by either taking a picture or uploading one from your photo library. Outputs top two predictions along with confidence.

## Running the app
To run our app, clone the repository and run it in Xcode. Can run the app either on a simulator or by connecting an iPhone to your laptop by cable.
