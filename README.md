## Reverse Food Image Search

Final project for McGill Artificial Intelligence Society's machine learning bootcamp. 

## What it does
Our iOS app takes in an image of a food item and with some ML magic outputs the name of the dish! Try it out for yourself! Can currently categorize food into one of 70 categories by either taking a picture or uploading one from your photo library. Outputs top two predictions along with confidence.

## Running the app
To run our app, clone the repository and run it in Xcode. Can run the app either on a simulator or by connecting an iPhone to your laptop by cable. The final trained model is included, or you can go through training one yourself in the Final_model.ipynb which loads the data, trains the model, all the way to converting the model to .mlmodel format.
